# Effect of Shift Work on the Incidence of Reflux Esophagitis
A research collaboration with Rabin Medical Center

**Background:** This analysis investigates the association between shift work and the incidence of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) among the nursing staff at Beilinson Hospital. Previous research based on nurses from Iran1 has suggested that shift work, which disrupts circadian rhythms, can increase GERD symptoms. Our study aimed to explore this relationship within a healthcare setting.\
\
**Methods:** We utilized a dataset encompassing 2,384 nurses, 195 of whom had been diagnosed with GERD. The exposure to shift work was determined using a scoring formula. Covariates known to impact GERD diagnosis were balanced via a matching strategy, leading to the creation of comparable diagnosed and undiagnosed groups.\
\
**Results:** Our statistical analyses didnâ€™t find association between GERD diagnosis and increased exposure to shift work. This unexpected finding, contradicting our initial hypothesis, was further enhanced by a subgroup analysis providing support evidence to the robustness of this conclusion.\
\
**Conclusion:** This counterintuitive result calls for further investigation of the connection between shift work and GERD. It is anticipated that subsequent research will shed light on these preliminary findings, aiding the ongoing effort to mitigate GERD incidence and improve healthcare worker wellbeing.
